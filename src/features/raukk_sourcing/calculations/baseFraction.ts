/**
 * Base fraction of a plan from the daily amounts it draws elsewhere.
 *
 * A plan occupies its own base plus, per source plan, the cost weighted
 * share of that sources output it consumes, multiplied by the sources
 * own base fraction. Drawing half of a single output plans production
 * therefore yields `1 + 0.5 = 1.5`, and the recursion carries deeper
 * chains upwards: a source at 1.5 drawn at 50% adds 0.75.
 *
 * Values above the number of plans in the empire are possible and
 * meaningful, nothing is clamped: a high base fraction is exactly the
 * signal that a product chain ties up more permits than it is worth.
 *
 * Guards: tickers a source does not produce (any more) and outputs
 * without daily units are skipped, a source snapshot without a stored
 * base fraction counts as 1. A draw of the plan against itself — own
 * output feeding own repairs — is skipped entirely: the own base is
 * already the leading 1, counting a self draw would inflate it and
 * feed back into itself on every recompute.
