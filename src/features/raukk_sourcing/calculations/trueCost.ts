/**
 * Calculates a plans true break-even cost per output unit.

 * the freight of those inputs. Shipping is a bucket of its own that
 * rides the very same allocation as the inputs bucket instead of being
 * folded into the prices, so `breakdown.shipping` keeps meaning what it
 * says. They are allocated to output tickers with the same share logic
 * the upstream
 * COGM uses (`usePlanCalculation.ts`): a buildings cost is split across
 * its active recipes by runtime share, a recipes cost is split across
 * its outputs proportional to output amount (the `costSplit` branch of
 * `outputCOGM`).
 *
 * Self consumption is already netted in `planResult.materialio`: only
 * net inputs (`delta < 0`) are paid for and only net outputs
 * (`delta > 0`) receive an allocation. A recipe whose outputs are fully
 * consumed inside the plan carries no weight; its cost is redistributed
 * across the plans net outputs. Runtime shares left idle and buildings
 * without an active recipe hold a residual as well, they still cost
 * workforce and repair — it is redistributed the same way.
 *
 * Prices are supplied by the caller through `resolveInputPrice`, which
 * decides market mode versus another plans transfer price. Whenever it
 * reports a `fromPlanUuid` the daily units are recorded in `draws`.
